This directory contains all of the core functionality for MABE.  This code should never be
changed for individual experiments.

# Layout

The core components of MABE are below.  This first group are tools that have minimal internal dependencies (indicated by indentation below the requirement).

data_collect.hpp    - Tools to extract data from elements in a container. 
SigListener.hpp     - Tool to trigger a specified member function on other classes when triggered.
TraitInfo.hpp       - Specifications for module/trait interactions (on organisms, populations, etc.)
  TraitManager.hpp  - Manager for dealing with many requests for trait management.
TraitSet.hpp        - Collections of traits, all with the same type (or a vector of that type)

Specialty modules in MABE have a linear dependency; each module listed below is dependent on all of those above it.

ModuleBase.hpp      - Core functionality for interfacing with all module types.
Organism.hpp        - Information about a single agent; ModuleBase is interface for OrganismManager.
OrgIterator.hpp     - Tools for identifying organism locations and stepping through sets of them.
Population.hpp      - Collection of Organisms (some of which could be EmptyOrganisms)
Collection.hpp      - A more flexible collection of organisms or whole populations for manipulation.
MABEBase.hpp        - Handles restricted core MABE functionality and provides interface to MABEScript
MABEScript.hpp      - Builds on Emplode to provide the full MABE scripting language.
MABE.hpp            - Main controller object; manipulates Populations and Organisms
Module.hpp          - Modify main MABE controller functions.
FactoryModule.hpp   - Framework to build specialty modules that manage other config objects.
OrganismManager.hpp - Specialty Module type to manage organisms with shared configuration.
EmptyOrganism.hpp   - Specialty Organism type to represent empty cells.


# Component Development

When Building new components for MABE, new organism types should be derived from a mabe::OrganismTemplate and new modules should be derived from mabe::Module (for regular modules).  If you want to add a new type in config that needs to be managed (as are organisms, brains, and genomes) this can be done with FactoryModule.

## Adding Organisms

A new specialty organism class must use OrganismsTemplate<ORG_T> as a base class, where ORG_T is the type of the new organism.  New organism classes must also override a few specialty functions to specify the configuration parameters that it uses.

## Adding Modules

## Adding Managed Configuration Types


# Core MABE Development

## Adding new Module Signals

From a design perspective, we should keep the number of module signals to a minimum.  If you
decide that an additional signal is required, carefully follow the checklist below to add it.
If any step is missed, the results can end up being hard to debug.

ModuleBase.hpp:
* Add a description of the new signal in the comments at the top of the file.
* Add a SIG_* id for the signal in the SignalID enum
* Declare a virtual member function to catch the signal in the SIGNALS section.
* Declare a virtual *_IsTriggered() to later test if we are currently reacting to signal.

Module.hpp:
* Override virtual function for signal (base method to mark function not used in module!)
* Override virtual function *_IsTriggered() to refer back to main MABE module.

MABEBase.hpp
* Setup a new SigListener in the member variables section
* Initialize the new SigListener in the initializer section of the MABEBase constructor.

MABE.hpp:
* Add a *_IsTriggered() function to test if the associated signal was triggered by a given module.
* Hook in a signal trigger in the appropriate place(s), as needed.


# Next steps in Core MABE Development

* MABE::FindInjectPosition should use modules explicitly associated with a specific population, not scan all modules.  This can be setup by modules declaring themselves as handling population structure needing to indicate WHICH populations (perhaps in SetupModule()?)

* Problem to resolve: trait access will often be limited to have only one module WRITE a trait.  These seem important for organism managers, but that limitation should only be for THAT organism type.  If, for example, we have a bits trait, ANY organism manager should be able to write to that trait.  A simple solution would be to have access apply to ALL organism managers when any one needs to set it.

* Problem to resolve: We want configuration to be able to provide equations (e.g., for a fitness function), not just always putting in a final value.  Perhaps setup with functions?  Or strings that get interpreted within the module?  Or a specialty module that interprets strings and writes the result to a different trait?

* Problem to resolve: Different types of organisms will have different traits that they need to deal with.  For example, "Wolves" vs "Sheep".  Do unused values just stay at a default?  Or can we have organism categories that each have their own trait layouts?

* Setup Organisms to be composed of brains, genomes, and adaptors (to be assembled during configuration).  Right now organisms must be built as a whole class, which is much less flexible.
